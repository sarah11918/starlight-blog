Use visual emphasis for conveying meaning, not intonation.
:::

Often when we write, we use styles like bold or italics to convey the way our sentence *sounds in our own head*. This helps us ensure that readers get our meaning, and often that they also get a taste for our personal voice and style. Word emphasis make or break understanding a sentence... or a writer!

Ideally, documentation doesn't need this same kind of reliance on the writer's voice to guide you through the text. This is just one more reason to favour shorter, "boring" sentences.

One PR suggestion I will make is to **visually mark the entire idea you want to get across, not just the individual words that may affect how the sentence is understood**. For docs, I prefer to rewrite so that these style markers aren't necessary in the first place. But, if you *are* going to call inline attention to a word or phrase because it's *that* important, then optimize for the readers who are skimming your page.

Consider what your reader will see when skimming your inline styles, and what information you are *really* conveying to them. What will a reader take away if **"not"** is all they see? And, if my sentence depends on being read it in *exactly* one way, then maybe I need to reconsider how clear it really is. 😅

Fun fact: **links automatically include their own inline styling**. Sometimes, I'll realize that I've previously written about the idea I want to emphasize. Using links to emphasize may not recreate my personal, super cool style. But, default link styling *will* catch a reader's attention and *can* help me suggest a particular rhythm or flow in a sentence. At the same time, you've given your reader helpful context if they'd like to explore more about *why* this might be an important idea!
