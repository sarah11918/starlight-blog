## Open-Source

I am a core maintainer and the Docs Lead  for [Astro](https://astro.build), and open-source web framework. I also write and speak about managing and maintaining community-driven, open-source documentation.

## Personal

In my "past life" in Toronto, I helped hundreds of students through high school & university as a private tutor, teacher, academic advisor, school administrator and guidance / university admissions counsellor. I used several stylus-based tablet PCs for taking/making digital math notes long before tablets were a thing. I was also an active volunteer in the Ontario homeschooling and alternative edudation communities: writing, advising, and speaking at conferences.

Now, from our island waterfront home in Atlantic Canada, I enjoy bird photography on our scenic boardwalk and am involved with local community choirs.

Other personal interests include a good cappuccino, a new-to-me gin, watching Toronto Blue Jays baseball on PVR delay so we can skip commercials (no spoilers!), stylus-based gadgets (#ALLtheSamsung, plus many niche devices you've probably never heard of), and natural disaster movies where the rogue atmospheric physicist saves the day.

My home is currently Summerside, PEI, Canada / Epekwitk (though I will always be "from Toronto"). My actual physical location could be anywhere in the world as a constant travel companion to my loving husband Joe, with whom the epic "Oshawa vs. Brampton" battle is ongoing.
