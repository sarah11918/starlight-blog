Here are some things I've recently been reading and enjoyed/learned from!

- [Why 95% Of Your Community Visitors Don’t Participate (And What You Should Do About It!)](https://www.feverbee.com/lurkersandlearners/) and [Stop Undervaluing Community Engagement Skills! – Communities Die Without Them](https://www.feverbee.com/engagementskills/) by Richard Mulligan of FeverBee.
- [Building navigation for your documentation site: 5 best practices in design](https://idratherbewriting.com/files/doc-navigation-wtd/design-principles-for-doc-navigation/) by Tom Johnson at I'd Rather Be Writing.
- [Designing Navigation for Content-Heavy Sites](https://tri.be/blog/designing-navigation-for-content-heavy-sites/) by Kyle at Modern Tribe. (He eats hot dogs.)
- [Information Architecture for Navigation](https://abbycovert.com/writing/information-architecture-for-navigation/) by sensemaker Abby Covert.

I may come back and expand upon these, or I may follow up in later posts. There are no rules! This is my first "Reads!"
