These "reads" also include some great "watches" I thought I'd share!

## Code and Coffee: A virtual coffee conference 

I always appreciate the events put on by CFE (Certified Fresh Events), and the first ever [Code and Coffee virtual conference](https://cfe.dev/events/virtual-coffee-conf-2025/) was no exception!

I was super impressed by [Accessibility is for Everyone!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DiDm4yKaZg) by Micha Rodgriguez. This was Micha's first ever conference talk, and wow is this a sign of great things to come from them!

Then, I had to go off and lie down after Abbey Perini's [Coding and ADHD: Where We Excel](https://www.youtube.com/live/EvDJpN-jJgo?si=13gwIVGzjQ5cZYpo&t=13347) because, oh no, am I just realizing at age 50 that my particular neurospiciness and social anxiety might actually be undiagnosed Inattentive ADHD and Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria? (Also presented at dotJS.)

Trillium Smith gave a fantastic [demo of Talon Voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3xaH1pJKsI) that makes me want to start using it right now exclamation point

## FOSS Backstage 2025

I devour anything from Shauna Gordon-McKeon, and [Relationship Problems in Open Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRPusk1cgc) was no exception! This came close on the heels of reading her insightful [
Six Ways to Onboard New Contributors](https://relational-tech.com/blog/six-ways-to-onboard.html).

## Posts

Ashley Willis-McNamara reflects on reflect on how the role has evolved, and where itâ€™s headed in [What is developer advocacy? (2025 edition)](https://ashley.dev/posts/what-is-developer-advocacy/). This struck a particular chord with me because it so perfectly articulates some of the sometimes difficult-to-justify "glue work" that holds an open-source project together.

And, finishing off with an apology. I'm sorry, Emily. I promise I will never recklessly eschew footnotes again after reading [Hi. I'm Terrified, Creatively Constipated, and Existentially Angsty as Fuck. And I'm Judging Every Word of This Post. And It's Not What I Want It to Be](https://fromemily.com/hi-im-terrified/).
