I also write and speak about managing and maintaining community-driven, open source documentation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://astro.badg.es/v1/contributor/sarah11918.svg\" alt=\"Astro badge contributions\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"astro-origin-story\">Astro Origin Story</h3>\n<p>I am a former math teacher/tutor who started to learned to code in 2018 because I inherited a crappy website I volunteered to maintain for my community choir and only knew enough HTML to be dangerous. I started taking online HTML, CSS then eventually JavaScript and React courses through <a href=\"https://scrimba.com\">Scrimba</a>. After I had taken all their “boot camp” courses, I was ready to convert my personal Jekyll blog to a JavaScript framework where I could actually build from the ground up and understand every file in my repo.</p>\n<p>That’s when I discovered Astro, which was <em>very</em> (very!) new and I had to make a choice: go with Gatsby which had a big community and tons of resources (since I was very new to web dev/Jamstack in general), or this new thing that no one had ever heard of but people were just starting to talk about which had a very small documentation site and an active, friendly, welcoming Discord. I figured Gatsby was the <em>safer</em> bet, but the Astro community won me over.</p>\n<p>Being one of the first people to use Astro, and being there as even some of the earliest features were being actively developed, I may not have known very much about software development, but I knew a lot about how <em>Astro</em> worked. I found that as new, even very experienced devs came into the Discord asking for help with their projects, <em>I</em> was able to help them because of my familiarity with Astro.</p>\n<p>I spent hours every day in support threads, and testing out every feature and providing feedback. Although I was much more involved in how Astro worked (and sharing that knowledge with our community) rather than how it was built, eventually I became familiar enough with some aspects of the project code that I could contribute small fixes or improvements directly.</p>\n<p>I was invited to be a maintainer of the project because of my (mostly “non-code”) contributions, and eventually was asked to first contribute as a technical writer (Who’s using their English degree <em>now</em>!) and then eventually lead the entire documentation project… which is itself an Astro (Starlight) website.</p>\n<p>I’m now a core maintainer with significant responsibilities in several aspects of maintaining this open source project, which requires a LOT more than code to function! I have spoken about documentation, “non-code contributions” to open source, community building and.. all three: using documentation as community building for your open source project!</p>\n<p>In fact, many of Astro’s contributors and maintainers were first onboarded as <em>docs</em> contributors, including translators! Their familiarity with Astro through careful docs contributions (and, translators have to understand what you’ve written backwards and forwards to be able to express it in another language!) often gave them confidence to then begin making <em>code</em> contributions, because they understood how Astro worked. Astro Docs is a <em>great</em> place to contribute, even if it’s your very first contribution to open source, and this is an initiative I have championed in my capacity as a community leader.</p>\n<h2 id=\"personal\">Personal</h2>\n<p>In my “past life” in Toronto, I helped hundreds of students through high school &#x26; university as a private tutor, teacher, academic advisor, school administrator and guidance / university admissions counsellor. I used several stylus-based tablet PCs for taking/making digital math notes long before tablets were a thing. I was also an active volunteer in the Ontario homeschooling and alternative edudation communities: writing, advising, and speaking at conferences.</p>\n<p>Now, from our island waterfront home in Atlantic Canada, I enjoy bird photography on our scenic boardwalk and am involved with local community choirs.</p>\n<p>Other personal interests include a good cappuccino, a new-to-me gin, watching Toronto Blue Jays baseball on PVR delay so we can skip commercials (no spoilers!), stylus-based gadgets (#ALLtheSamsung, plus many niche devices you’ve probably never heard of), and natural disaster movies where the rogue atmospheric physicist saves the day.</p>\n<p>My home is currently Summerside, PEI, Canada / Epekwitk (though I will always be “from Toronto”). My actual physical location could be anywhere in the world as a constant travel companion to my loving husband Joe, with whom the epic “Oshawa vs. Brampton” battle is ongoing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hobbies-and-interests\">Hobbies and interests</h2>\n"
